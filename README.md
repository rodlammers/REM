# REM
The River Erosion Model (REM), an intermediate complexity model for simulating stream channel evolution at the watershed scale.

To use, download the REMv0.1.0.exe file. For guidance on using REM, download REM_User_Guide.html, right click and save the file, and open it in a browser. Example model run files are available in the Test Case.zip folder.

The REM Model Tests.zip folder contains model input and output files for the North Fork Toutle River and Colorado River tests that were used to examine model accuracy. For more details on this, see the this publication: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169418307303?dgcid=rss_sd_all, or the pre-print version: https://eartharxiv.org/zgekr/.

I've created an R Shiny app that serves as a simple graphical user interface for the model. It can be downloaded and run through R here: https://github.com/rodlammers/REMgui.

Model outputs can be processed and visualized either in the Shiny app or using the R package REMvisualizer (only available from github): https://github.com/rodlammers/REMvisualizer.
